## About the project

This website summarizes a school project for the [Applied Data
Analysis](https://adaepfl.github.io) course at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch).

This project has several goals and challenges :

* retrieve "running" data from [Datasport](https://www.datasport.com), the
  website of a service provider for sport events, on which one can find results
* run statistical analysis on this data
* build a website to display the results of the previous part, and also to
  propose a more user-friendly way to look at the data than the Datasport
  website itself.

The data and the different steps for scraping and analyzing the data can be
found [on this GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ggrrll/hop_suisse_ada_project_public). Note that
the repository contains extra content not displayed on this website, mostly in
[this
directory](https://github.com/ggrrll/hop_suisse_ada_project_public/tree/master/6-data_analysis),
we invite the interested reader to check it. We mainly used Jupyter notebooks
and plot libs such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to get started quickly.

## About the team

## About the website

We decided to use a Jekyll-powered website hosted on GitHub Pages for its
simplicity.

We also use several libraries and tools throughout the pages :

* [C3.js](http://c3js.org) on top of [D3.js](https://d3js.org)
* [jQuery-Autocomplete](https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete)
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
* [Glyphicons Free](https://glyphicons.com)
* [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

## About the title

"Hop Suisse !" is the support slogan for Swiss athletes and teams during sport
events. It can roughly be translated as "Go Switzerland !" :-)
