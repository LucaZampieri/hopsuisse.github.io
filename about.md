## About the project

This website summarizes a school project for the [Applied Data
Analysis](https://adaepfl.github.io) course at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch).

This project has several goals and challenges :

* retrieve "running" data from [Datasport](https://www.datasport.com), the website
  of a sport event organizer, on which one can find results
* run exploratory and statistical analysis on this data
* build a website to display the results of the previous part, and also to
  propose a more user-friendly way to look at the data than the Datasport
  website itself.

The data and the different steps for scraping and analyzing the data can be
found [on this GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ggrrll/hop_suisse_ada_project_public). We mainly
used Jupyter notebooks and plot libs such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to get
started quickly.

## About the team

We are five students currently at EPFL :

* Ondine Chanon
* Antonio Iubatti
* Gianrocco Lazzari
* Maxime Peschard
* Stefano Savar√®

## About the website

We decided to use a Jekyll-powered website hosted on GitHub Pages for the sake
of simplicity and ease of use.

We also use several libraries and tools throughout the pages :

* [C3.js](http://c3js.org) on top of [D3.js](https://d3js.org)
* [jQuery-Autocomplete](https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete)
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
* [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
